## Procedure

The final project has two GUI components.  The first one will require you to have a small window that the user will be able to enter their user name and select their favorite Star Wars Character.  You will use the Generics component to help you with this process.  The user should select their favorite character with a button.  The window should look similar to appendix 1.  

Once the user finishes entering the name and selecting the character, then the user should select submit and the window should disappear.  The second window should now open up with the name and character already filled in.  This window will take the data from a file.  

Each line from the file has three things.  The first is a movie or television character name.  The second is a movie or television character name.  The third is who would win (the answer) if these characters versed each other.  The object of the game is to guess who I believe would win if these characters vs each other.  Every time the user answers a question, two new characters appear for the user to make another choice.  See File Processing Component.

Once a user clicks on a button to choose, then the answer will appear below along with if they got it correct or not.  A timestamp will be recorded every time a user makes a choice.  This is where your Data Structure component will be used.

At the bottom of the GUI is a (horizontal) crawling text like you would see in Times Square (stock ticker).  You will add your Threads component here.

When the program is finished asking questions about characters versing each other.  Then the score and the user name will be submitted to the database.  See the Database component.

Also, the user will have the ability to click on a button to print the report of the highest scores.  See File Processing component.

Appendix 2 is an example of what the window should look like
